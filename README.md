# Spry Simulation Excel add-in

Spry Simulation is Microsoft Excel add-in which enables system dynamics, discrete-event and Monte Carlo simulation in modern spreadsheets, especially with small to medium-sized simulation models and for a proof-of-concept tasks. It brings additional spreadsheet functions that represent event generators, queues, state variables, delays, loops and other simulation elements that you can connect together while designing the model in spreadsheet. 

During simulation run, Spry mimicks the passage of time by recalculating the model several times, for each consequtive time period. Data collection and statistics for specific cells in the model that interest you is also arranged as a spreadsheet function. Besides this, simulation models usually include stochastic variables, so to get reilable results Spry can repeat the whole model several times.
